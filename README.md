# 1. Installation
1. Clone [crt](https://github.com/naumenko-sa/crt), [cre](https://github.com/naumenko-sa/cre), and [bioscripts](https://github.com/naumenko-sa/bioscripts) to
`~/crt`, `~/cre`, and `~/bioscripts`.
2. Set PATH: `export PATH=~/crt/scripts:~/cre/scripts:~/bioscripts/scripts` in ~/.bash_profile.
3. Install [bcbio_nextgen](https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio-nextgen), set PATH and PYTHONPATH:
```
export PATH=/path/bcbio/anaconda/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/path/bcbio/anaconda/lib/python2.7
```

# 2. Create a bed file for prioritization of small and structural variants
	* request a list of ensembl_ids for genes
	* if a gene list comes from Phetotips:\
```Rscript ~/bioscripts/genes.R phenotips_hpo2gene_coordinates phenotips_hpo.tsv```. Stringr should be >=1.4.
	* or use [genes.R](https://github.com/naumenko-sa/bioscripts/blob/master/genes.R) in a custom case
	* Some genes might be missing (don't have ENS IDs in a phenotips tsv file, they are reported by script, you can try ~/cre/data/missing_genes_grch37.bed or GeneCards/Ensembl resources to find them).
	* sort and merge with bedtools\
	```
	bedtools sort -i unsorted.bed > sorted.bed
	bedtools merge -i sorted.bed > project.bed
	```
	* result is project.bed
	* Good sources of gene panels are:
		* [Panel App from Genomics England](https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/)
		* [Gene panel app from iobio.io](https://genepanel.iobio.io/)

# 3. Align reads vs GRCh37 reference with decoy
	* Create a project(=case=family) dir:\
	`mkdir -p project/input`
	* Copy/symlink input file(s) to project/input: project_sample.bam, or project_sample_1.fq.gz and project_sample_2.fq.gz
	* Create bcbio project:\
	`crg.prepare_bcbio_run.sh project align_decoy`
	* Run bcbio project:\
	`qsub ~/cre/bcbio.pbs -v project=project`\
	For multiple projects create list of projects in projects.txt and run\
	`qsub -t 1-N ~/cre/bcbio.array.pbs`\
	where N = number of projects.
	* To speed up the process, run one project per sample.

# 4. Remove decoy reads:\
`qsub ~/cre/cre.bam.remove_decoy_reads.sh -v bam=$bam`.\
Keep original bam with decoy reads to store all data.\
Some SV callers (manta) are sensitive to reads mapped to decoy even with one mate.

# 5. Call small variants
 	* Create a project dir:\
 	`mkdir -p project/input`
 	* Symlink bam file(s) from step1 to project/input: project_sample.bam Small variant calling is not sensitive to the presense of decoy reads.
 	* Create bcbio project:\
 	`crg.prepare_bcbio_run.sh project small_variants`
	* Run bcbio:\
	`qsub ~/cre/bcbio.pbs -v project=project`
	* Clean up bcbio project:\
	`qsub ~/cre/cre.sh -v family=<project>,cleanup=1,make_report=0,type=wgs`

# 6. Create excel reports for small variants.
	* coding report:\
	`qsub ~/cre/cre.sh -v family=project`
	* noncoding variants for gene panels: 
		- subset variants:\
		`bedtools intersect --header -a project-ensemble.vcf.gz -b panel.bed > project.panel.vcf.gz`
		- reannotate variants in panels and create gemini.db:\
		`qsub ~/cre/cre.vcf2cre.sh -v original_vcf=project.panel.vcf.gz,project=project `
		- build report:\
		`qsub ~/cre/cre.sh -v family=project,type=wgs`
	* noncoding variants for gene panels with flank
		- modify bed file, add 100k bp to each gene start and end:\
		`cat panel.bed | awk -F "\t" '{print $1"\t"$2-100000"\t"$3+100000}'`
		- proceed as for noncoding small variant report
	* de-novo variants for trios

# 7. Call structural variants (in parallel with step 3)
	* MetaSV calls spades - a genome assembler, for every SV, making bcbio run computationally intensive. To speed up use sv_regions.bed and call samples individually. They are combined downstream during report generation.
	* Create project dir:\
	`mkdir -p project/input`
	* Symlink a bam file. from step 2 to project/input: project_sample.bam.
	* Copy project.bed to project.input
	* Create bcbio project:\
	`crg.prepare_bcbio_run.sh project sv project/input/sv_regions.bed`\
	* Run bcbio:\
	`qsub ~/cre/bcbio.pbs -v project=project`

# 8. Create excel reports for structural variants  ([Report columns](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o870tr0rcshoae_VkG1ZOoWNSAmorCZlhHDpZuZogYE/edit?usp=sharing))
	* Navigate to `project/sv`
	* Report on SV's occuring in each sample: 
		- Run: `crg.sv.prioritize.sh sample panel.bed` on the *-metasv.vcf.gz file in each sample's folder. 
		- *Optional* crg.sv.prioritize.sh will produce a `sample.tsv` file. A contact in TCAG can annotate this file to add an additional column to the sample's SV report, DGV. Otherwise, this column will show up as NA. Run `crg.sv.prioritize.sh sample panel.bed tcag_annotated_file.tsv` to produce this report.
	* Report on SV's across multiple samples: 
		- Gather each report from the previous step in to a single directory
		- Run: `crg.intersect_sv_reports.sh project` to produce a single report summarizing structural variants across all samples

## AnnotSV
[AnnotSV](http://lbgi.fr/AnnotSV/) must be set up as apart of the local environment to generate family level reports. Users should set FeaturesOverlap and SVtoAnnOverlap to 50 in the configFile. Because these scripts group SV's which have a 50% recipricol overlap, annotation should follow a similar rule.

# Report columns:
- CHR
- POS
- GT
- SVTYPE
- SVLEN
- END
- SOURCES: which programs called the event
- NUM_SVTOOLS: how many programs supported the event
- GENES: genes overlapping the event (mostly one gene)
- ANN: raw annotation from VEP
- SVscores: [SVscore-github](https://github.com/lganel/SVScore), [SVscore-article](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/7/1083/2748212)
  - SVSCOREMAX
  - SVSCORESUM
  - SVSCORETOP5
  - SVSCORETOP10
  - SVSCOREMEAN
- DGV: frequency in DGV, 8000 WGS

# Family report
crg.intersect_sv_reports.py generates a report summarizing structural variants across several samples. It groups structural variants of similar size and position in to a single "reference" structural variant. Grouping is useful when analyzing families as most structural variants should be similar and conserved across samples.

The script produces a CSV file which can be analyzed using spreadsheet software.

## Family report requirements:

### ~/gene_data directory containing the following files:
	HGMD=${HOME}/gene_data/HGMD_2018/hgmd_pro.db
	EXON_BED=${HOME}/gene_data/protein_coding_genes.exons.fixed.sorted.bed
	HPO=${HOME}/gene_data/HPO_2018/${FAMILY_ID}_HPO.txt
	EXAC=${HOME}/gene_data/ExAC/fordist_cleaned_nonpsych_z_pli_rec_null_data.txt
	OMIM=${HOME}/gene_data/OMIM_2018-11-01/genemap2.txt

### AnnotSV
[AnnotSV](http://lbgi.fr/AnnotSV/) must be set up as apart of the local environment to generate a family report. Users should set FeaturesOverlap and SVtoAnnOverlap to 50 in the configFile. Because these scripts group SV's which have a 50% recipricol overlap, annotation should follow a similar rule.

DGV and DDD columns are annotated by [AnnotSV](http://lbgi.fr/AnnotSV/).
